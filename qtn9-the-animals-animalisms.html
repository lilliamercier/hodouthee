The first British Invasion actually had two strains: the pop-rock strain as exemplified by the Beatles, The Dave Clark Five, and Herman's Hermits; and the garage-blues strain as exemplified by The Rolling Stones, The Yardbirds, and The Animals. The first incarnation 
 You can take it further in time but I'd like it to at least reach the fall of the Soviet Union. CLAPS So let us say that one way or another you end up in the Old World of Darkness and end up getting embraced and becoming a Vampire of one kind or another. . . what kind would you be/prefer and why? For a Refresher here are the Clans: Brujah: The Social Warriors and Rebels of the Vampire Clans, these brutish ruffians seek to challenge the status quo and serve as the muscle of their respective factions. Powers include Super Strength, Super Speed , and Presence(The ability Okay. Weird one. Suppose that a Kindred with animalism decides to ghoul an intelligent animal like, say, a chimpanzee or an octopus. They would use Animalism to converse with it, right? Ghouls can learn disciplines from their parent clans, in a limited way. Would this hypothetical ghoul be able to use Animalism to speak to humans, or even other animals? Edit: Thanks for the insight, everybody. This was meant as a what-if, and not intended to start an argument. I'm aware The game is Fifth Edition. I'm playing a heart of gold Nosferatu who watches over the homeless and addicts of the city. He feeds almost exclusively on animals and as such specializes in Obfuscate to remain unseen amidst the homeless and also Animalism. What I cannot decide for the life of me though is whether or not to take Animal Succulence or Unliving Hive. Their benefits are as follows: Animal Succulence: Feeding from animals slakes 1 additional Hunger, and the vampire counts. Hi, just wondering on a couple points, appreciate any input. If someone has a long-term pet like a beloved dog, would that particular dog react with hostility or distrust in the absence of something like animalism? Would them being confused but quickly realising their master is just a little different as long as they behave the same be more realistic? Similarly, I'm wondering about the psychological effects of ghouling on animals like dogs. Say a nosferatu with low animalism adopts some abandon. Don't you understand how much of a game changer cum sprite edits are? For months we've been rolling in the filth like pigs; treating toe memes as the pinnacle shit posting but we've forgotten the essential elements that make shitposting what it is! Absurdity and subversion. foot fetishes are so common these days and the other two subs are so shameless about it that it's no longer absurd and because we've been milking the meme for so long it's no longer subversive. So why are cum sprite edits. Everyone has watched pornography. It’s a fact of modern society that because sexual material is readily available for public consumption that people will seek it out and view it. We’ve all done it, so with that fact aside I can move on to talk about something that has taken a toll on my mental state since I discovered pornography as a teen. I’m just going to come out and say it, interracial pornography is a special kind of cancer. I say special kind because I think pornography in general.

I'm fighting the arbitrary, day after day. Won't you save me from this meaninglessness? Why would you anyway. I'll give myself meaning. Any kind of meaning. Wretched or not. A deal with the devil inside myself. Take it to the edge. Go all in. Put it all on the line. Sacrifice everything, morality and empathy, for money, for power. It's just the way of the world. I'm truly sorry, in the way that I drag my unrelentingly virtuous self across jagged glass concrete of a broken world. Like a kid dragg. ### Chadwick “Chad” Wingate Williamson-Mason III Epitaph: These waters are treacherous and so am I. Quote: “And that was the second year in a row Muffy, Trevor, Judson and I placed in the race to Mackinac. Ahaha!” Clan: Ventrue (Gangrel) Mortal Days: Sailing, over the bounding main Chadwick Wingate Williamson-Mason – of the Salem Williamson-Masons – enjoyed the privilege of his bloodline as the product of two old and fine New England families. “Chad”. I'm approaching this using maieutics. The Socratic gadfly if you will. Consider me asking questions not making conclusive statements. Aren't we just smarter animals? This is the antidote to nice guy behaviour. When a nice guy gets horny he doesn't assert his natural instincts, instead he suppresses them. TRP loves evolution and here is the question. If a nice guy is more in touch with primal instincts doesn't he transcend his backward "morality". This is the problem, religion has convinced peopl. 
In this letter I intend to express my views about T-Series with gentleness and respect. First, the misinformation: T-Series suggests that a plausible excuse is a satisfactory substitute for performance. Where the heck did it come up with that? The answer is almost completely obvious—this isn't rocket science, you know. The key is that if T-Series had its way, schools would teach students that the kids on the playground are happy to surrender to the school bully. This is not education https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OzZKv (https://www.artstation.com/artwork/OzZKv) https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Animalism\_(VTM) (https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Animalism_(VTM)) 1. Animalism is a discipline shared between many clans, so it is less unique to our clan members, with many players and storytellers not wanting to focus on those skills and abilities with the Tzimisce (aside from summoning beings to practice vicissitude upon or commanding their flesh creations. T-Series's demands are so rife with ignorance, erroneous information, and poorly conceived notions of stoicism that I hardly know where to begin. Even disregarding obvious errors like its insistence that it can bring about peace and prosperity for the whole of humanity through violence, deception, oppression, exploitation, graft, and theft, the fallacies of its claims are glaring to those of us who have educated ourselves about the implications of anarchism. With this letter, I hope to reveal. When assessing T-Series's hariolations, one need not resort to vicious name-calling or opprobrious epithets. One need only present the facts. To get right down to it, T-Series is blind to the truth. That's clear. But some things really get my goat. For instance, not only does T-Series repeatedly get away with oppressing, segregating, and punishing others, but it once even received an award from a group of huffy sods for bad-mouthing worthy causes.
